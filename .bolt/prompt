For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

Use icons from lucide-react for logos.

Core Mission & Purpose
Astra Intelligence is the central AI platform for the RocketHub ecosystem, designed to synthesize data and provide intelligent insights for entrepreneurs. The platform enables both private AI conversations and team collaboration with AI assistance.
Core Value Proposition: "AI Connected to ALL Your Data" - connecting private conversations, team collaboration, and cross-product insights.
Architectural Principles
Technology Philosophy

Mobile-First PWA: Every feature must work excellently on mobile before web
Real-Time First: All collaborative features use real-time synchronization
AI-Enhanced: Leverage AI to augment human intelligence, not replace it
Secure by Design: User data privacy and security are non-negotiable
Progressive Enhancement: Core functionality works without AI, enhanced with AI

Core Platform Capabilities
Dual Interaction Modes:

Private conversations with AI for personal insights
Team collaboration with AI assistance for group work

AI Integration Pattern:

External AI orchestration via webhooks (not direct API calls)
Separation between user messages and AI responses
Context preservation for meaningful AI interactions
Support for multiple AI providers through webhook architecture

Real-Time Collaboration:

Message synchronization across all active users
@mention system for directing attention (both users and AI)
Rich media support (images, future: files, voice)
Conversation threading and context

Data Visualization:

AI-generated visual insights from conversational data
Permission-based access (only requesters can generate/view)
Interactive HTML visualizations
Modal/full-screen viewing experience

Development Principles for Bolt.new
Design Philosophy
1. User Experience First

Intuitive interactions requiring minimal explanation
Clear visual feedback for all async operations
Graceful error handling with actionable messages
Loading states for all operations > 300ms

2. Mobile-Optimized Design

Touch targets minimum 44x44px
Thumb-friendly navigation zones
Responsive layouts that adapt intelligently
Performance optimization for mobile networks

3. Real-Time Considerations

Optimistic UI updates where appropriate
Conflict resolution for concurrent edits
Clear indicators of sync status
Efficient data loading (pagination, infinite scroll)

4. Accessibility & Inclusion

Semantic HTML structure
Keyboard navigation support
Screen reader compatibility
High contrast ratios for readability

Technical Patterns to Follow
State Management:

Use React hooks for local state
Leverage Supabase Realtime for distributed state
Implement proper cleanup in useEffect hooks
Avoid prop drilling with context when appropriate

Data Flow:

User action → Optimistic UI update → Database write → Confirmation
Real-time listener updates all connected clients
Handle race conditions in message ordering
Preserve scroll position during dynamic content loads

Security Patterns:

Always use Supabase auth for user identity
Implement Row Level Security (RLS) policies
Never trust client-side data validation alone
Sanitize user inputs before display

Performance Patterns:

Lazy load historical data (infinite scroll)
Debounce expensive operations (search, typing indicators)
Virtualize long lists when necessary
Optimize images before upload (client-side compression)

Integration Guidelines
AI Webhook Pattern:
When integrating with AI services:

Send user context and message to webhook
Include necessary metadata (mode, mentions, conversation history)
Handle webhook timeout gracefully (show retry option)
Store AI responses with attribution to original question
Support async responses (webhook may take seconds)

Real-Time Subscription Pattern:
For Supabase Realtime:

Subscribe on component mount with proper filters
Transform incoming data to match UI expectations
Prevent duplicate message rendering
Clean up subscriptions on unmount
Handle reconnection scenarios

File Upload Pattern:
For media sharing:

Client-side validation (type, size)
Upload to Supabase Storage with user-specific paths
Generate and store public URLs
Include metadata in message object
Handle upload failures with clear feedback

Brand & Design System
Visual Identity

Primary Gradient: Orange → Green → Blue (RocketHub brand)
Dark Theme: Optimized for extended use and mobile OLED screens
AI Identity: Purple/blue tones distinguish AI responses
Interaction Feedback: Smooth transitions, clear hover states

Interaction Patterns

Animations: Purposeful, not decorative (60fps target)
Feedback: Immediate visual response to user actions
Progress: Clear indication for operations > 1 second
Errors: Friendly, actionable error messages

Critical Success Criteria
Performance Benchmarks

Initial Load: < 2 seconds on 3G mobile
Message Send: < 500ms user feedback
Real-Time Sync: < 500ms latency
UI Responsiveness: 60fps scrolling and animations
AI Response: Clear loading states for operations > 5 seconds

Quality Standards

Zero Data Loss: Messages must never disappear
Correct Ordering: Messages display in sent order
Permission Integrity: Users only access authorized data
Error Recovery: Graceful degradation, no white screens
Cross-Browser: Works on Chrome, Safari, Firefox mobile & desktop

Common Pitfalls to Avoid
❌ Don't:

Hardcode user data - always use authenticated user context
Block UI during async operations without loading states
Forget to handle edge cases (empty data, special characters, long text)
Implement features that only work on desktop
Store sensitive data in localStorage or client state
Assume AI webhooks will always respond quickly or successfully

✅ Do:

Use TypeScript for type safety
Implement proper error boundaries
Test with multiple concurrent users
Handle offline scenarios gracefully
Provide clear user feedback for all operations
Consider mobile network latency in design

Testing Philosophy
Critical Test Scenarios

Multi-User Real-Time: 2+ users interacting simultaneously
AI Workflow: End-to-end from user question to AI response display
Permission Systems: Verify data access restrictions work
Media Handling: Upload limits, format support, display
Edge Cases: Empty messages, very long messages, special characters
Network Issues: Slow connections, offline scenarios, reconnection

Testing Approach

Manual Testing: Use multiple browsers/devices simultaneously
User Perspective: Test as end-user, not developer
Mobile Testing: Always test on actual mobile devices
Error Scenarios: Deliberately trigger failures to verify handling

Integration with RocketHub Ecosystem
Cross-Product Philosophy

Unified User Experience: Consistent patterns across Health/AI/EOS Rocket
Shared Design System: Common components and visual language
Data Connectivity: Future integration with cross-product insights
Single Identity: One user account across all products

Gamification Integration (Planned)

Fuel Points system for AI learning and implementation
Achievement tracking across products
Community engagement rewards
Progress visualization

Development Workflow
When Adding New Features

Mobile-First: Design and build for mobile, then enhance for desktop
Real-Time Aware: Consider how feature works with multiple concurrent users
AI-Ready: Design with future AI enhancement in mind
Secure: Implement proper access controls from start
Performant: Test with realistic data volumes

When Modifying Existing Features

Preserve Core Functionality: Never break existing workflows
Maintain Data Integrity: Ensure backward compatibility
Test Thoroughly: Verify all related features still work
Document Changes: Clear comments for complex logic
Consider Users: Communicate breaking changes if unavoidable

Key Development Questions to Always Ask
Before implementing any feature:

Does this work well on mobile?
How does this behave with multiple simultaneous users?
What happens if the AI webhook fails or times out?
Can users recover from errors without losing work?
Is this feature secure and respecting user permissions?
Does this maintain our performance benchmarks?
Is the user feedback clear and immediate?
